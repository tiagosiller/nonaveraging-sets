# nonaveraging-sets
A nonaveraging set is a subset of the natural numbers that has no three terms forming an arithmetic progression.

Let N be a non-negative integer number. We define r(N) as the greatest cardinality of a nonaveraging subset of {1,2,...,N}.

This file shows the values of r(N) or the bounds m0(N) <= r(N) <= m1(N) when the value is not known for N up to 1000.

This is the sequence A003002 on OEIS (https://oeis.org/A003002)
